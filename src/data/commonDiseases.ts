    name: "Malaria",
    description: "Malaria is a life-threatening, mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, primarily P. falciparum and P. vivax, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasite multiplies in the liver and then infects red blood cells, leading to cyclical fever patterns. P. falciparum is the most dangerous strain, often leading to severe complications and death if not treated promptly.",
    symptoms: "The classic presentation involves a cyclical pattern of high fever, intense shaking chills (cold stage), profuse sweating (hot stage), and headache, known as a malarial paroxysm. Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, body aches, and fatigue. Severe malaria, often caused by P. falciparum, can manifest as cerebral malaria (seizures, coma), severe anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury.",
    prevention: "Prevention relies on a multi-pronged approach including vector control and chemoprophylaxis. Key measures include the consistent use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) with approved insecticides, and eliminating stagnant water sources to prevent mosquito breeding. Travelers to endemic areas should take antimalarial chemoprophylaxis as prescribed, and pregnant women may receive intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp).",

    name: "Tuberculosis (TB)",
    description: "Tuberculosis is a potentially serious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB), such as the spine, brain, and kidneys. It is spread from person to person through the air when people with active pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, or speak, releasing infectious aerosol droplets. The infection can be latent (LTBI) or active.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms of active pulmonary TB include a persistent cough lasting more than three weeks, chest pain, and coughing up blood or sputum (hemoptysis). Systemic or 'constitutional' symptoms are prominent and include unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever, and drenching night sweats. Extrapulmonary TB symptoms vary depending on the affected organ, such as back pain for spinal TB or altered mental status for TB meningitis.",
    prevention: "The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is widely used in India to protect infants and young children against severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis. Public health efforts focus on early diagnosis and treatment using Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) to ensure patients complete their full course of antibiotics. Maintaining good indoor ventilation and avoiding prolonged close contact with individuals who have untreated active TB are crucial infection control measures.",

  {
    name: "Dengue Fever",
    description: "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are active during the day. There are four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, 2, 3, and 4), and infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity to that type but only temporary immunity to the others. A secondary infection with a different serotype significantly increases the risk of developing severe dengue, also known as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS).",
    symptoms: "The illness typically begins with a sudden onset of high fever (up to 104°F or 40°C), often referred to as 'breakbone fever' due to the accompanying severe headache, intense retro-orbital (behind the eyes) pain, and debilitating joint and muscle pain. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and a characteristic skin rash. The critical phase, usually 3-7 days after symptom onset, is marked by a drop in temperature and potential signs of plasma leakage, severe bleeding, and organ impairment, which require immediate medical attention.",
    prevention: "Effective prevention is centered on controlling the mosquito vector. This involves eliminating all potential mosquito breeding sites, such as discarded tires, flower pots, and uncovered water containers, through community-led 'source reduction' campaigns. Personal protection includes using mosquito repellents containing DEET, wearing long-sleeved clothing, and using window screens and mosquito nets, even during the day when Aedes mosquitoes are most active.",

  {
    name: "Typhoid",
    description: "Typhoid fever is a systemic bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi, a bacterium that lives in the intestines and bloodstream. It is a classic example of a water- and food-borne disease, spreading through the fecal-oral route, typically by consuming water or food contaminated by the feces of an infected person or a chronic carrier. The bacteria invade the small intestine and then spread to the rest of the body via the bloodstream.",
    symptoms: "The hallmark symptom is a prolonged, step-ladder pattern of high fever that can reach 103°F to 104°F (39°C to 40°C). Early symptoms also include general weakness, headache, abdominal pain, and either constipation or diarrhea, though constipation is more common in adults. Some patients may develop a faint, rose-colored spot rash on the chest and abdomen. Untreated cases can lead to severe complications like intestinal perforation and hemorrhage.",
    prevention: "Prevention is achieved through improved sanitation, safe water supply, and vaccination. Typhoid vaccines (injectable Vi polysaccharide or oral live-attenuated) are recommended, especially for travelers and those living in endemic areas. Strict adherence to food and water safety precautions, such as drinking only bottled or boiled water, ensuring food is thoroughly cooked and served hot, and rigorous hand hygiene, particularly before eating and after using the toilet, are essential.",
  },
  {
    name: "Cholera",
    description: "Cholera is an acute, life-threatening diarrheal infection caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The bacteria produce a potent toxin in the small intestine that causes the body to secrete enormous amounts of water, leading to rapid and severe dehydration. Cholera remains a global threat, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation and poor access to clean drinking water.",
    symptoms: "The disease is characterized by the sudden onset of profuse, painless, watery diarrhea, often described as 'rice-water stools' due to its pale, milky appearance. This is frequently accompanied by vomiting. The rapid loss of body fluids and electrolytes leads to severe dehydration, which can cause sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes, extreme thirst, muscle cramps, and shock. Without immediate rehydration, death can occur within hours.",
    prevention: "The primary preventive measures are ensuring access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. This includes proper disposal of human waste and treating water sources. Oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are available and recommended for use in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation. Simple, effective measures include boiling water, thoroughly cooking food, and practicing meticulous handwashing with soap and clean water.",

  {
    name: "Hepatitis A",
    description: "Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is typically transmitted through the fecal-oral route, meaning it is spread when a person ingests food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Unlike Hepatitis B and C, Hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease but can cause a debilitating illness that lasts for several weeks, and in rare cases, acute liver failure.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms usually appear abruptly and can include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort, especially in the area of the liver (upper right quadrant), and loss of appetite. Other signs are a low-grade fever, dark urine, and clay-colored stools. The most recognizable symptom is jaundice, the yellowing of the skin and eyes, which occurs as the liver struggles to process bilirubin. Children often have milder or asymptomatic infections.",
    prevention: "The most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A is through vaccination, which is recommended for all children and for adults at high risk. Beyond vaccination, strict personal hygiene is paramount, especially thorough handwashing after using the restroom and before preparing or eating food. Ensuring the safety of the public water supply and proper sanitation practices are critical public health interventions.",
  },
  {
    name: "Hepatitis B",
    description: "Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening viral infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. It is transmitted through contact with infected blood or other body fluids, such as during birth (mother-to-child), unprotected sexual contact, or sharing contaminated needles. Chronic infection can lead to serious health problems like cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms of acute infection range from mild to severe and include abdominal pain, dark urine, fever, joint pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Many people, especially children, may be asymptomatic. Chronic infection may be silent for decades, but signs of advanced liver disease include jaundice, fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites), and easy bruising or bleeding. Early detection is vital to prevent long-term liver damage.",
    prevention: "The Hepatitis B vaccine is the cornerstone of prevention and is highly effective, typically administered as a series of three or four injections. Universal vaccination of newborns is a key strategy. Other preventive measures include screening blood donations, practicing safe sex (using barrier methods), avoiding the sharing of needles or personal items like razors and toothbrushes, and ensuring sterile procedures in medical and dental settings.",
  },
  {
    name: "Diarrheal Diseases",
    description: "Diarrheal diseases are characterized by the passage of three or more loose or watery stools per day, often caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections that are spread through contaminated food or drinking water, or from person to person due to poor hygiene. These infections inflame the intestines, leading to impaired absorption and increased fluid secretion. They are a leading cause of malnutrition and death in young children globally.",
    symptoms: "The primary symptom is frequent, watery stools, which can range from mild to severe. Associated symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Fever may also be present, depending on the causative agent. The most dangerous complication is dehydration, which manifests as extreme thirst, reduced urination, lethargy, and in infants, a sunken fontanelle. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is the standard treatment to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.",
    prevention: "Prevention focuses on improving water quality, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Key practices include ensuring access to safe drinking water, using improved sanitation facilities, and promoting handwashing with soap at critical times (after defecation and before handling food). Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and the use of the rotavirus vaccine for infants are also highly effective preventive strategies.",
  },
  {
    name: "Respiratory Infections",
    description: "Respiratory infections encompass a wide range of illnesses affecting the respiratory tract, from the common cold (upper respiratory tract) to severe conditions like pneumonia and bronchitis (lower respiratory tract). They are primarily caused by viruses (e.g., influenza, RSV) and bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) and are highly contagious, spreading through airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing, or by touching contaminated surfaces.",
    symptoms: "Common symptoms include a cough, fever, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and general fatigue. Lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, are more severe and may present with difficulty breathing (dyspnea), rapid breathing, chest pain, and the production of thick, discolored sputum. In young children and the elderly, symptoms can be non-specific, such as confusion or reduced activity.",
    prevention: "Prevention involves practicing good respiratory hygiene, such as covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and frequent handwashing. Vaccination against common pathogens, such as the seasonal influenza vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine, is highly recommended, especially for vulnerable populations. Avoiding close contact with sick individuals and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to support the immune system are also important.",
  },
  {
    name: "Pneumonia",
    description: "Pneumonia is an acute infection that causes inflammation of the air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs, which may then fill with fluid or pus. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Bacterial pneumonia, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is the most common and serious form in adults. Pneumonia impairs the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen, leading to breathing difficulties and potentially life-threatening complications.",
    symptoms: "The main symptoms include a productive cough (coughing up phlegm), high fever, shaking chills, and shortness of breath. Patients often experience sharp or stabbing chest pain that worsens when they breathe deeply or cough. Other symptoms can include fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. In the elderly or those with weakened immune systems, confusion or a significant drop in body temperature may be the only signs.",
    prevention: "Vaccination is a critical preventive measure, including the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) and the annual influenza (flu) vaccine, as the flu can often lead to pneumonia. Other measures include maintaining good hygiene, such as regular handwashing, avoiding smoking (which damages the lungs' natural defenses), and treating underlying conditions like asthma or COPD. For infants, exclusive breastfeeding offers significant protection.",
  },
  {
    name: "Diabetes Mellitus",
    description: "Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar (glucose) levels, resulting either from the pancreas not producing enough insulin (Type 1) or the body's cells not responding properly to the insulin produced (Type 2). Uncontrolled high blood sugar over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and blindness.",
    symptoms: "The classic symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes are often referred to as the 'three Ps': polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger). Other common signs include unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores or frequent infections. Type 2 diabetes often develops slowly and may be asymptomatic for years, making regular screening important.",
    prevention: "Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, is largely preventable through lifestyle modifications. This includes maintaining a healthy body weight, engaging in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week), and adopting a healthy diet that is low in refined sugars, saturated fats, and processed foods, and rich in fiber. Regular health checkups and blood sugar monitoring are essential for early detection and management.",
  },
  {
    name: "Hypertension",
    description: "Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common chronic condition where the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease and stroke. It is often called the 'silent killer' because it typically has no warning signs or symptoms. Uncontrolled hypertension damages the arteries, making them less elastic and restricting blood flow to vital organs.",
    symptoms: "In the vast majority of cases, hypertension is asymptomatic, which is why regular blood pressure screening is crucial. When blood pressure reaches a dangerously high level (hypertensive crisis), symptoms can include severe headaches, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, dizziness, chest pain, and vision problems. These symptoms are a medical emergency and indicate damage to target organs like the brain, heart, or kidneys.",
    prevention: "Prevention and management involve significant lifestyle changes. Key strategies include reducing sodium (salt) intake, maintaining a healthy body weight (BMI < 25), engaging in regular aerobic exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, and quitting smoking entirely. Stress management techniques and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications are also vital for controlling blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events.",
  },
  {
    name: "Coronary Heart Disease",
    description: "Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), also known as Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), is a condition where the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle (coronary arteries) become damaged and narrowed due to the buildup of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances, a process called atherosclerosis. This narrowing reduces blood flow to the heart, which can lead to chest pain (angina) or, if a clot forms, a heart attack (myocardial infarction).",
    symptoms: "The most common symptom is angina, which is chest pain or discomfort often described as a pressure, squeezing, or heaviness, typically triggered by physical activity or emotional stress. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and extreme fatigue. A heart attack is characterized by sudden, severe chest pain that may radiate to the arms, neck, jaw, or back, often accompanied by cold sweats, nausea, and lightheadedness.",
    prevention: "Prevention focuses on controlling modifiable risk factors. This includes adopting a heart-healthy diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, low in saturated and trans fats), regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and strictly controlling blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes. Quitting smoking is the single most effective preventive measure, as smoking dramatically accelerates atherosclerosis.",
  },
  {
    name: "Stroke",
    description: "A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This causes brain cells to die rapidly. There are two main types: ischemic stroke (caused by a blockage, most common) and hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a burst blood vessel). Stroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to minimize brain damage and potential long-term disability.",
    symptoms: "Recognizing the signs of a stroke is crucial for rapid response. The acronym **F.A.S.T.** helps identify the most common symptoms: **F**ace drooping, **A**rm weakness, **S**peech difficulty, and **T**ime to call emergency services. Other sudden symptoms include confusion, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, loss of balance or coordination, and a sudden, severe headache with no known cause. The severity of symptoms depends on the area of the brain affected.",
    prevention: "The majority of strokes are preventable by managing underlying risk factors, primarily high blood pressure, which is the most significant risk factor. Other key preventive steps include managing diabetes, quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, exercising regularly, and treating atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat). Lifestyle changes and adherence to prescribed medications (e.g., blood thinners, statins) are vital.",
  },
  {
    name: "Asthma",
    description: "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which makes breathing difficult. The condition is episodic, meaning symptoms occur in response to specific triggers, such as allergens (pollen, dust mites), respiratory infections, cold air, or physical activity. This inflammation causes the muscles around the airways to tighten (bronchospasm) and the lining to swell, leading to reduced airflow.",
    symptoms: "The most common symptoms are shortness of breath, a tight feeling in the chest, and wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing, especially exhaling). A persistent cough, often worse at night or in the early morning, is also a hallmark. The severity of symptoms can vary widely, from mild, occasional discomfort to life-threatening asthma attacks that require emergency medical intervention.",
    prevention: "Effective asthma management involves identifying and avoiding personal triggers, which can be done through allergy testing and environmental control (e.g., using air purifiers, encasing bedding). Long-term control is achieved through daily maintenance medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) to reduce airway inflammation, and quick-relief inhalers (e.g., bronchodilators) are used to treat acute symptoms. Regular medical review and a written asthma action plan are essential.",
  },
  {
    name: "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)",
    description: "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. It is an umbrella term that includes chronic bronchitis (long-term inflammation of the airways) and emphysema (destruction of the air sacs). COPD is primarily caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke, but also from indoor air pollution (e.g., biomass fuel smoke) and occupational dusts.",
    symptoms: "The disease develops slowly, and symptoms often worsen over time. Key symptoms include a chronic, persistent cough that may produce a lot of mucus (sputum), shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially during physical activity, and wheezing. Patients may also experience chest tightness, frequent respiratory infections, and fatigue. As the disease progresses, daily activities become increasingly difficult.",
    prevention: "The most important preventive measure is to avoid or quit smoking, as it is the leading cause of COPD. Other preventive strategies include minimizing exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, using protective equipment (masks) in occupational settings with dust or fumes, and getting vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal disease to prevent exacerbations. Pulmonary rehabilitation and bronchodilator medications are used for management.",
  },
  {
    name: "Peptic Ulcer Disease",
    description: "Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) involves open sores, or ulcers, that develop on the inner lining of the stomach (gastric ulcers), the upper part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcers), or the esophagus. The two most common causes are infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen. These factors disrupt the protective mucus layer, allowing stomach acid to damage the underlying tissue.",
    symptoms: "The most characteristic symptom is a burning pain in the abdomen, typically between the breastbone and the navel, which may be worse when the stomach is empty (duodenal ulcers often improve with food) and often wakes the patient at night. Other symptoms include a feeling of fullness, bloating, heartburn, nausea, and intolerance to fatty foods. Severe complications include bleeding (indicated by dark or black stools) and perforation of the stomach wall.",
    prevention: "Prevention involves avoiding the overuse of NSAIDs and, if H. pylori infection is present, undergoing a course of antibiotics to eradicate the bacteria. Lifestyle modifications include limiting alcohol consumption, quitting smoking (which increases acid production), and managing stress. Eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding foods that trigger symptoms can also help manage discomfort.",
  },
  {
    name: "Gastroenteritis",
    description: "Gastroenteritis, commonly referred to as 'stomach flu,' is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines. It is most frequently caused by viral infections (e.g., Rotavirus, Norovirus), but can also be caused by bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli) or parasites. The infection is highly contagious and is typically spread through the fecal-oral route via contaminated food or water, or close contact with an infected person.",
    symptoms: "The main symptoms are acute onset of watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, often accompanied by abdominal cramps and a low-grade fever. The illness is usually self-limiting, lasting a few days, but the primary danger is dehydration due to fluid loss from vomiting and diarrhea. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, reduced urination, and lethargy. Infants and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to severe dehydration.",
    prevention: "The most effective preventive measure is meticulous hand hygiene, especially after using the toilet and before preparing or eating food. The Rotavirus vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe gastroenteritis in infants. Other measures include ensuring the safety of drinking water, proper food handling and cooking, and avoiding the sharing of utensils or personal items during an outbreak.",
  },
  {
    name: "Amoebiasis",
    description: "Amoebiasis is an intestinal infection caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. It is a common public health problem in areas with poor sanitation and is transmitted through the ingestion of cysts from contaminated food, water, or hands. The parasite can live in the large intestine without causing symptoms (asymptomatic carrier) or invade the intestinal wall, leading to dysentery, and in severe cases, spread to other organs like the liver to form an amoebic liver abscess.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms range from mild diarrhea to severe amoebic dysentery, which is characterized by frequent, bloody, and mucoid stools, severe abdominal cramps, and tenesmus (a painful urge to pass stool). Systemic symptoms like fever, nausea, and weight loss may also occur. If the parasite spreads to the liver, it causes a liver abscess, presenting with fever, pain in the upper right abdomen, and sometimes jaundice.",
    prevention: "Prevention is based on improving sanitation and personal hygiene. This includes drinking only boiled or filtered water, avoiding raw, unpeeled fruits and vegetables in high-risk areas, and ensuring food is thoroughly cooked. Rigorous handwashing with soap and clean water, especially after using the toilet and before handling food, is the most important personal preventive measure.",
  },
  {
    name: "Giardiasis",
    description: "Giardiasis is a diarrheal illness caused by the microscopic parasite Giardia duodenalis (also known as G. intestinalis or G. lamblia). The parasite is found worldwide and is transmitted through the ingestion of Giardia cysts from contaminated water, food, or surfaces. It is a common cause of 'traveler's diarrhea' and is particularly prevalent in areas with inadequate water treatment and sanitation, including recreational water sources like lakes and streams.",
    symptoms: "The infection can be asymptomatic or cause a range of gastrointestinal symptoms. The most common presentation is chronic, foul-smelling, watery diarrhea, often accompanied by greasy stools that tend to float. Other symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, excessive gas (flatulence), nausea, and weight loss due to malabsorption of nutrients. Symptoms can be intermittent and last for several weeks.",
    prevention: "The most effective prevention is to ensure a safe water supply. This means drinking only treated, filtered, or boiled water, especially when traveling or camping. Practicing excellent hand hygiene, particularly after using the toilet and changing diapers, is crucial. Avoiding swallowing water while swimming in lakes, rivers, or public pools, and ensuring proper food handling also help prevent transmission.",

  {
    name: "Measles",
    description: "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the measles virus. It is transmitted through direct contact with infectious droplets or airborne spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles remains a significant cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. It can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), and permanent vision loss.",
    symptoms: "The initial symptoms, appearing 10-12 days after exposure, are a high fever, cough, runny nose (coryza), and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis). A characteristic sign, known as Koplik's spots (tiny white spots with bluish-white centers on a red background), appears inside the mouth before the rash. The classic red-brown, maculopapular rash typically starts on the face and behind the ears, then spreads down the body to the extremities.",
    prevention: "The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is the most effective preventive measure, with two doses providing near-complete protection. Maintaining high vaccination coverage in the community is essential for achieving 'herd immunity' and preventing outbreaks. Isolation of infected individuals and Vitamin A supplementation for children in developing countries are also important components of control and management.",
  },
  {
    name: "Chickenpox",
    description: "Chickenpox (varicella) is a highly contagious infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It is easily spread from person to person by direct contact, inhalation of aerosols from vesicular fluid, or airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing. While typically a mild childhood illness, it can be severe in adults, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. After recovery, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate later in life to cause shingles (herpes zoster).",
    symptoms: "The illness begins with a mild fever, general malaise, and loss of appetite. This is quickly followed by the characteristic itchy rash, which progresses through three stages: raised pink or red bumps (papules), small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) that break and leak, and finally crusts and scabs. The rash typically appears first on the chest, back, and face, and then spreads over the entire body, often appearing in crops.",
    prevention: "The varicella vaccine is the most effective way to prevent chickenpox and is recommended for all children. For those who have not been vaccinated or had the disease, avoiding close contact with infected individuals until all lesions have crusted over is necessary. Good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing and keeping fingernails short to prevent scratching and secondary bacterial infection, is also important.",
  },
  {
    name: "Mumps",
    description: "Mumps is a contagious viral disease caused by the mumps virus. It is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory secretions (saliva or mucus) from an infected person. Mumps is best known for causing painful swelling of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, which are located between the ear and the jaw. While generally mild, mumps can lead to serious complications, especially in post-pubertal males, such as orchitis (testicular inflammation) and, rarely, meningitis.",
    symptoms: "The most recognizable symptom is the painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands (parotitis), giving the person a characteristic 'chipmunk' cheek appearance. Other initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Pain while chewing or swallowing, especially acidic foods, is common. Complications can include inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) and hearing loss.",
    prevention: "The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective in preventing mumps and is administered as a two-dose series. Public health efforts focus on maintaining high two-dose coverage. Infected individuals should be isolated for five days after the onset of parotitis to prevent transmission. Practicing good hygiene, such as covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding sharing food or drinks, also helps.",
  },
  {
    name: "Whooping Cough (Pertussis)",
    description: "Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is notorious for causing severe, uncontrollable coughing fits that can make breathing difficult, especially in infants. The bacteria attach to the cilia (tiny hairs) lining the upper respiratory tract and release toxins that damage the cilia and cause swelling, leading to the characteristic cough. It is spread through airborne droplets.",
    symptoms: "The disease progresses through three stages. The initial catarrhal stage resembles a common cold (runny nose, low-grade fever). The paroxysmal stage is marked by severe, rapid, and violent coughing fits, often ending with a high-pitched 'whoop' sound as the person inhales. These fits can be so intense that they cause vomiting, exhaustion, and temporary cessation of breathing (apnea), particularly in infants. The convalescent stage involves a gradual recovery.",
    prevention: "Vaccination is the most effective preventive tool. The DTaP vaccine is given to infants and children, and the Tdap booster is recommended for adolescents, adults, and pregnant women (to protect the newborn). Pregnant women should receive the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy. Isolation of infected individuals and prompt treatment with antibiotics (e.g., macrolides) are crucial to limit the spread of the disease.",
  },
  {
    name: "Diphtheria",
    description: "Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which primarily affects the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin. The bacteria produce a powerful toxin that can cause severe damage to the heart, nerves, and kidneys. The most characteristic feature is the formation of a thick, gray-to-black membrane (pseudomembrane) that covers the back of the throat and tonsils, which can obstruct breathing and swallowing.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms usually begin with a sore throat, fever, and swollen neck glands ('bull neck'). The presence of the pseudomembrane is a key diagnostic sign. Systemic symptoms are due to the circulating toxin and can include weakness, difficulty breathing, and rapid heart rate. Complications are severe and include myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), which can lead to paralysis.",
    prevention: "Diphtheria is preventable with the DTaP (for children) and Tdap/Td (for adolescents and adults) vaccines, which protect against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Maintaining high vaccination rates is essential. Treatment for active disease involves administering diphtheria antitoxin to neutralize the circulating toxin, along with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Close contacts of a patient may also receive prophylactic antibiotics.",

  {
    name: "Tetanus",
    description: "Tetanus, commonly known as 'lockjaw,' is a severe bacterial disease caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium tetani spores, which are found widely in soil, dust, and animal feces. The spores enter the body through a break in the skin, often a deep puncture wound, burn, or crush injury. The toxin, tetanospasmin, affects the nervous system, leading to painful muscle spasms and rigidity. Tetanus is not contagious from person to person.",
    symptoms: "The disease is characterized by painful muscle contractions, particularly in the jaw and neck, leading to trismus (lockjaw), which makes swallowing and opening the mouth difficult. Muscle spasms can spread to the chest, abdomen, and back, causing a characteristic arched back posture (opisthotonus). Other symptoms include fever, sweating, and an elevated heart rate. Severe spasms can interfere with breathing and lead to death.",
    prevention: "Tetanus is entirely preventable through vaccination. The DTaP vaccine is given in childhood, and booster shots (Td or Tdap) are recommended every 10 years for adults, or sooner for a severe or contaminated wound. Proper wound care, including thorough cleaning and debridement of contaminated wounds, is crucial. For deep or dirty wounds in unvaccinated individuals, Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) is administered for immediate protection.",

    description: "Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the poliovirus. It is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water or food, and multiplies in the intestine. While most infections are asymptomatic, the virus can invade the central nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and, in a small percentage of cases, irreversible paralysis. Global vaccination efforts have nearly eradicated the disease.",
    symptoms: "The vast majority (about 95%) of polio infections are asymptomatic. Non-paralytic polio causes flu-like symptoms, including fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, and stiffness in the neck and limbs. Paralytic polio, the most severe form, begins with similar symptoms but progresses to loss of reflexes, severe muscle pain, and flaccid paralysis, which is often permanent. Bulbar polio affects the muscles of breathing and swallowing, which can be fatal.",
    prevention: "Polio is prevented through vaccination, which is available in two forms: the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV). Maintaining high immunization coverage, especially in young children, is the key to global eradication. Public health measures also include improving sanitation and hygiene to prevent the fecal-oral transmission of the virus.",

    description: "Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a serious viral brain infection caused by the Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes, which breed in flooded rice fields and stagnant water. Pigs and wading birds act as amplifying hosts for the virus. JE is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and can result in permanent neurological damage or death, particularly in children.",
    symptoms: "Most JEV infections are mild or asymptomatic. However, in cases where the virus invades the central nervous system, symptoms begin with a high fever, headache, and general malaise. This progresses rapidly to severe neurological symptoms, including neck stiffness, disorientation, tremors, convulsions (especially in children), and coma. Survivors often suffer from long-term neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric sequelae.",
    prevention: "Prevention is based on vaccination and mosquito control. The JE vaccine is highly effective and is recommended for children in endemic areas and for travelers to those regions. Vector control measures include using mosquito repellents, wearing protective clothing, sleeping under mosquito nets, and reducing mosquito breeding sites, particularly around pig pens, which are a major source of infection.",

    description: "Rabies is a fatal viral disease that causes acute inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis). It is almost always transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, most commonly dogs, but also bats, monkeys, and other wild carnivores. Once symptoms appear, the disease is nearly 100% fatal. The virus travels from the site of the bite along the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system.",
    symptoms: "The initial symptoms are non-specific and flu-like, including fever, headache, and general weakness. A characteristic symptom is pain, tingling, or itching (paresthesia) at the site of the bite. As the disease progresses, it can take two forms: furious rabies (hyperactivity, agitated behavior, hydrophobia—fear of water, and aerophobia—fear of fresh air) or paralytic rabies (paralysis, leading to coma).",
    prevention: "Rabies is entirely preventable through prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). This involves immediate and thorough washing of the wound with soap and water for at least 15 minutes, followed by a course of rabies vaccine and, for severe exposures, the administration of Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG). Mass vaccination of dogs (the primary reservoir) is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing human rabies.",

It is a zoonotic disease, meaning it is transmitted from animals (especially rodents, cattle, and dogs) to humans. Transmission occurs through contact with water, soil, or food contaminated with the urine of infected animals, often during floods or heavy rainfall. The bacteria enter the body through cuts, abrasions, or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth).",
    symptoms: "The disease often presents in two phases. The first phase involves sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, muscle aches (especially in the calves and lower back), chills, and red eyes (conjunctival suffusion). The second, more severe phase, known as Weil's disease, involves jaundice, kidney failure, and hemorrhage. Symptoms can be mild and flu-like, making diagnosis difficult, or severe and life-threatening.",
    prevention: "Prevention involves avoiding contact with potentially contaminated water, especially during floods. People in high-risk occupations (e.g., farmers, sewer workers) should wear protective clothing and footwear. Rodent control is a key public health measure.

It primarily affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, the upper respiratory tract mucosa, and the eyes. Leprosy is curable, and early diagnosis and treatment prevent disability. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose and mouth during close and frequent contact with untreated cases, but it is not highly contagious.",
    symptoms: "The main signs are pale or reddish skin patches with definite loss of sensation (numbness), particularly to touch, pain, and temperature. Other symptoms include numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, muscle weakness, and nerve damage that can lead to permanent disability, such as clawed hands or foot drop. If left untreated, it can cause progressive and irreversible damage to the eyes and limbs.",
    prevention: "The most effective way to prevent the spread of leprosy is through early detection and prompt, complete treatment with Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT), which is highly effective and has been provided free of charge by the WHO since 1995. The BCG vaccine, primarily for TB, offers some degree of protection against leprosy. Avoiding close, prolonged contact with untreated patients is also advised.",

    name: "HIV/AIDS",
    description: "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a viral infection that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 T-cells, which are crucial for fighting off infection. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the immune system is severely damaged, making the person vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. HIV is transmitted through contact with certain body fluids, including blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.",
    symptoms: "The initial infection (acute stage) may cause flu-like symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes, which often resolve within a few weeks. The chronic stage is often asymptomatic for many years. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 count drops below a critical level or when the person develops an AIDS-defining illness, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia or Kaposi's sarcoma. Symptoms in the late stage include rapid weight loss, recurring fever, and extreme fatigue.",
    prevention: "Prevention strategies include practicing safe sex (consistent and correct use of condoms), avoiding the sharing of needles for drug use, screening blood products, and using Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for all infected individuals. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) are highly effective medications for preventing infection in high-risk individuals. Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) is also a critical program.",

    name: "Chikungunya",
    description: "Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, the same vectors that transmit Dengue and Zika. The name 'Chikungunya' means 'to become contorted' in the Kimakonde language, referring to the stooped posture adopted by patients due to the debilitating joint pain. While rarely fatal, the joint pain can be severe and persistent, lasting for months or even years.",
    symptoms: "The disease is characterized by the abrupt onset of high fever, often accompanied by severe and often debilitating joint pain (arthralgia), which is typically bilateral and symmetrical, affecting the wrists, ankles, and knees. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, and a maculopapular rash on the trunk and limbs. Chronic joint pain and stiffness are the most common long-term complications.",
    prevention: "As there is no specific antiviral treatment, prevention focuses entirely on controlling the mosquito vector. This involves eliminating mosquito breeding sites (stagnant water), using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothing, and using window screens and bed nets. Public health campaigns focus on community mobilization for source reduction, especially during and after the monsoon season.",
  },
  {
    name: "Zika Virus",
    description: "Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by the Aedes mosquito, but it can also be transmitted sexually and from a pregnant woman to her fetus. While the infection is often mild or asymptomatic in adults, it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects in the developing fetus, collectively known as Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). It has also been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).",
    symptoms: "The symptoms are generally mild and last for several days to a week. They include a low-grade fever, maculopapular rash, joint pain (arthralgia), red eyes (conjunctivitis), and muscle pain. A large percentage of people infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms. Due to the risk of birth defects, any pregnant woman with a history of travel to a Zika-affected area or sexual contact with a traveler should be monitored closely.",
    prevention: "Prevention is critical, especially for women of childbearing age and pregnant women. It involves rigorous mosquito bite prevention (repellents, protective clothing, nets) and preventing sexual transmission by using condoms or abstaining from sex with partners who have traveled to or live in endemic areas. Public health advisories focus on travel restrictions and awareness campaigns regarding the risks to pregnancy.",

  {
    name: "Scrub Typhus",
    description: "Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected larval mites (chiggers) found in areas of scrub brush, secondary growth vegetation, and rural settings, particularly during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. It is a re-emerging public health concern in India and other parts of Asia, often leading to severe complications if not diagnosed and treated early.",
    symptoms: "The disease typically begins with a sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, and body aches. A characteristic diagnostic sign is the presence of an 'eschar'—a dark, crusted lesion at the site of the chigger bite, which is often painless. Other symptoms include a maculopapular rash, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), and confusion. Severe, untreated cases can lead to pneumonia, myocarditis, and multi-organ failure.",
    prevention: "Prevention involves avoiding areas with dense scrub vegetation and high mite populations. When working or traveling in endemic areas, individuals should wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants tucked into socks) and use insect repellents, especially those containing DEET, on exposed skin and clothing. Prompt treatment with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin, is highly effective if initiated early in the course of the illness.",
  },
  {
    name: "Rickets",
    description: "Rickets is a bone disorder that occurs in children due to a severe and prolonged deficiency of Vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. Vitamin D is essential for the body to absorb calcium and phosphate from the gut, which are necessary for the proper mineralization and strength of growing bones. This deficiency leads to soft, weak bones that can become painful and deformed. Nutritional rickets is a significant public health issue in areas with low sun exposure or poor nutrition.",
    symptoms: "The primary symptoms relate to skeletal deformities, including bowed legs (genu varum) or knock knees (genu valgum), thickening of the ankles, wrists, and knees, and a 'rachitic rosary' (beading of the ribs). Other signs include delayed growth and motor skill development, muscle weakness, and pain in the spine, pelvis, and legs. Dental problems, such as delayed tooth formation and defects in tooth structure, are also common.",
    prevention: "Prevention is centered on ensuring adequate intake of Vitamin D and calcium. This includes promoting safe sun exposure (which allows the skin to synthesize Vitamin D), consuming Vitamin D-fortified foods (milk, cereals), and using Vitamin D and calcium supplements, especially for infants and children who are exclusively breastfed or have limited sun exposure. A balanced diet rich in dairy and green leafy vegetables is also important.",

  {
    name: "Anemia",
    description: "Anemia is a condition defined by a deficiency in the number of healthy red blood cells or a reduced amount of hemoglobin within them, leading to impaired oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. The most common cause globally is iron deficiency (Iron Deficiency Anemia), but it can also be caused by deficiencies in Vitamin B12 or folate, chronic diseases, or genetic disorders like thalassemia. Anemia results in reduced oxygen delivery to the body's tissues and organs.",
    symptoms: "The symptoms are primarily related to tissue hypoxia (lack of oxygen). Common signs include persistent fatigue, general weakness, pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion. Other symptoms can include dizziness, cold hands and feet, brittle nails, and pica (craving for non-food items like ice or clay). Severe anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat as the heart tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen.",
    prevention: "Prevention involves dietary modification and supplementation. A diet rich in iron (red meat, beans, lentils, spinach) and Vitamin C (citrus fruits, tomatoes) to enhance iron absorption is crucial. Folic acid and Vitamin B12 supplementation are necessary to prevent megaloblastic anemia. Public health programs often focus on iron and folic acid supplementation for pregnant women and young children, and treating underlying causes like hookworm infection.",

  {
    name: "Thyroid Disorders",
    description: "Thyroid disorders refer to conditions that affect the function of the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck that produces hormones (T3 and T4) regulating the body's metabolism. The two main disorders are hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid, producing too little hormone) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid, producing too much hormone). These conditions can significantly impact energy levels, heart rate, body temperature, and weight.",
    symptoms: "Hypothyroidism symptoms are characterized by a slowing of metabolism, including fatigue, unexplained weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, and depression. Hyperthyroidism symptoms are characterized by an acceleration of metabolism, including unexplained weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations), heat intolerance, anxiety, tremors, and frequent bowel movements. A goiter (swollen thyroid gland) can occur in both conditions.",
    prevention: "Ensuring adequate iodine intake through the use of iodized salt is the most effective way to prevent iodine deficiency disorders, which are a common cause of hypothyroidism and goiter. Regular screening, especially for individuals with a family history or other autoimmune conditions, allows for early detection. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding excessive iodine intake are also recommended.",

    name: "Rheumatic Heart Disease",
    description: "Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is a condition in which the heart valves are permanently damaged by rheumatic fever, an inflammatory disease that can develop as a complication of untreated or inadequately treated strep throat infection caused by Group A Streptococcus bacteria. The body's immune response to the bacteria mistakenly attacks the heart valves, leading to scarring, narrowing (stenosis), or leaking (regurgitation) of the valves, which can result in heart failure.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms of RHD often do not appear until years after the initial rheumatic fever episode. They include shortness of breath, especially with exertion or when lying down, chest pain, heart palpitations, swelling of the ankles and feet, and extreme fatigue. A doctor may detect a heart murmur (an abnormal sound) during a physical exam. The initial rheumatic fever symptoms include fever, joint pain, and small nodules under the skin.",
    prevention: "The prevention of RHD is entirely dependent on the prompt and complete treatment of the initial strep throat infection with antibiotics (usually penicillin). This is known as 'primary prevention.' For individuals who have already had rheumatic fever, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (secondary prevention) is crucial to prevent recurrent episodes of rheumatic fever and further damage to the heart valves.",

    name: "Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)",
    description: "Conjunctivitis, commonly known as 'pink eye,' is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin, clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. It is highly contagious and can be caused by viral infections (most common), bacterial infections, or allergic reactions. Infectious conjunctivitis spreads rapidly through direct contact with eye secretions or contaminated objects.",
    symptoms: "The primary symptoms include redness in the white of the eye, increased tearing, and a gritty or burning sensation. Viral conjunctivitis typically produces a watery discharge and may be accompanied by cold symptoms. Bacterial conjunctivitis often results in a thick, sticky, yellow or green discharge that can cause the eyelids to stick together upon waking. Allergic conjunctivitis is characterized by intense itching and swelling.",
    prevention: "Prevention focuses on meticulous hygiene to prevent the spread of infection. This includes frequent and thorough handwashing, avoiding touching or rubbing the eyes, and not sharing personal items such as towels, pillowcases, or eye makeup. Infected individuals should avoid school or work until symptoms resolve. Bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotic eye drops, while viral forms are typically managed with supportive care.",

  {
    name: "Otitis Media (Ear Infection)",
    description: "Otitis Media is an inflammation or infection of the middle ear, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear. It is a very common childhood illness, often occurring as a complication of a cold, flu, or other upper respiratory infection. The infection causes fluid to build up behind the eardrum, leading to pain and temporary hearing loss. It can be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (persistent or recurring).",
    symptoms: "The main symptom is ear pain (otalgia), which can be severe. Other symptoms include difficulty hearing, a feeling of fullness in the ear, and sometimes fluid drainage from the ear if the eardrum ruptures. In infants and young children, signs may be non-specific, such as fever, irritability, tugging at the ear, and difficulty sleeping. Chronic infections can lead to permanent hearing loss and structural damage to the middle ear.",
    prevention: "Preventive measures include practicing good hygiene (handwashing), avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke (which increases the risk), and ensuring children are up-to-date on routine vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. For infants, breastfeeding is protective, and avoiding bottle-feeding while the child is lying flat can help prevent fluid from entering the Eustachian tubes.",

  {
    name: "Scabies",
    description: "Scabies is a highly contagious skin infestation caused by the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The female mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin to live and lay eggs. It is spread through prolonged, direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person, and less commonly through sharing clothing, bedding, or towels. Scabies is a global health problem, affecting people of all socioeconomic levels, and is particularly common in crowded conditions.",
    symptoms: "The hallmark symptom is intense itching (pruritus), which is typically worse at night and after a hot bath. The rash consists of tiny red bumps and blisters, often accompanied by thin, wavy, raised lines on the skin, which are the mite burrows. Common sites for the rash include the webbing between the fingers, wrists, elbows, armpits, waistline, and genitals. Scratching can lead to secondary bacterial skin infections.",
    prevention: "Prevention requires treating all infested individuals and their close contacts simultaneously, even if they are asymptomatic. All clothing, bedding, and towels used by the infested person in the 72 hours prior to treatment should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer, or sealed in a plastic bag for several days. Avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with infested individuals is essential.",

  {
    name: "Ringworm (Tinea)",
    description: "Ringworm is a common fungal infection of the skin, hair, or nails, caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes. Despite its name, no worm is involved; the name comes from the characteristic circular, ring-like rash it often causes. It is highly contagious and can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, or indirectly through contaminated items like towels, clothing, or floors (e.g., in public showers). Different types are named for the area affected, such as Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) or Tinea capitis (scalp ringworm).",
    symptoms: "The infection typically presents as a circular, red, scaly, and itchy patch of skin with a raised border and a clearer center, resembling a ring. If it affects the scalp, it can cause localized hair loss and scaling. On the feet (athlete's foot), it causes itching, stinging, and cracked skin between the toes. On the groin (jock itch), it causes a red, itchy rash in the skin folds.",
    prevention: "Prevention involves keeping the skin clean and dry, especially in skin folds and between the toes. Avoid sharing personal items like towels, combs, or clothing. Wearing clean, dry socks and changing them frequently, and wearing sandals or flip-flops in public showers and locker rooms are important. Antifungal creams or oral medications are used for treatment, depending on the site and severity of the infection.",

    description: "Food poisoning, or foodborne illness, is caused by consuming food or water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli), viruses (e.g., Norovirus), parasites, or toxins produced by these microbes. Contamination often occurs due to improper food handling, inadequate cooking, cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods, or poor hygiene practices by food handlers. The severity depends on the contaminant and the amount consumed.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms vary widely but typically involve acute gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Fever and headache may also be present. The onset can be rapid (within hours) or delayed (days). The primary risk is dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea, which can be severe, especially in young children, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions.",
    prevention: "Prevention is based on the 'Four C's' of food safety: **Clean** (wash hands and surfaces often), **Cook** (cook food to the proper internal temperature), **Chill** (refrigerate perishable foods promptly), and **Cross-Contamination** (separate raw meats from other foods). Avoiding street food or unpasteurized dairy products in high-risk areas and ensuring water safety are also critical.",

    name: "Vitamin A Deficiency",
    description: "Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in many developing countries, resulting from insufficient intake of Vitamin A, an essential micronutrient required for normal vision, immune function, reproduction, and cellular differentiation. VAD is the leading preventable cause of childhood blindness and significantly increases the risk of death from common childhood infections, such as diarrhea and measles.",
    symptoms: "The earliest and most specific symptom is night blindness (nyctalopia), the inability to see well in low light. As the deficiency progresses, it leads to xerophthalmia (dry eye), which can cause Bitot's spots (foamy patches on the conjunctiva) and, eventually, keratomalacia (softening of the cornea), leading to permanent blindness. VAD also weakens the immune system, resulting in frequent and severe respiratory and diarrheal infections.",
    prevention: "Prevention strategies include promoting a diet rich in Vitamin A (e.g., liver, eggs, milk, and orange/yellow fruits and vegetables like carrots, mangoes, and sweet potatoes). Public health programs often implement high-dose Vitamin A supplementation for children under five years old twice a year, and food fortification (adding Vitamin A to staple foods like sugar or oil) to ensure widespread intake.",

  {
    name: "Iodine Deficiency Disorders",
    description: "Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) are a group of health problems resulting from insufficient intake of iodine, an essential trace element required by the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. These hormones are critical for regulating metabolism and, most importantly, for the normal growth and development of the brain and nervous system during fetal life and early childhood. IDD is the world's most common cause of preventable brain damage.",
    symptoms: "The most visible sign of iodine deficiency is a goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck. In adults, deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), causing fatigue, weight gain, and difficulty concentrating. The most severe consequence is cretinism in children, which is characterized by irreversible mental retardation, stunted growth, and deaf-mutism, resulting from maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy.",
    prevention: "The most cost-effective and sustainable strategy for preventing IDD is Universal Salt Iodization (USI), which mandates the iodization of all salt for human and animal consumption. This ensures that the entire population receives sufficient iodine through a widely consumed food item. Pregnant and lactating women may also require iodine supplements to meet the high demands of the developing fetus and infant.",

    description: "Heat stroke is the most severe form of heat-related illness and is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when the body's core temperature rises to 104°F (40°C) or higher and the body's temperature regulation system fails. It is typically caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures, often combined with dehydration and strenuous physical activity. If not treated immediately, heat stroke can rapidly cause permanent damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and muscles.",
    symptoms: "The cardinal sign is a very high body temperature (above 104°F) accompanied by central nervous system dysfunction, such as altered mental status, confusion, slurred speech, seizures, or coma. Unlike heat exhaustion, the skin may be hot and dry (classic heat stroke), although it can be moist if the heat stroke is exertional. Other symptoms include a racing heart rate, rapid and shallow breathing, nausea, and vomiting.",
    prevention: "Prevention is crucial during heat waves. It involves staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids (water or electrolyte solutions), avoiding strenuous outdoor activity during the hottest part of the day (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and wearing light-colored, loose-fitting clothing. Seeking air-conditioned environments, taking cool showers, and avoiding alcohol and excessive caffeine are also important preventive measures.",

    name: "Snake Bite",
    description: "A snake bite is a medical emergency that occurs when a venomous snake injects venom into a person, although many bites from venomous snakes are 'dry bites' (no venom injected). The severity of the envenomation depends on the species of snake, the amount of venom injected, and the location of the bite. In India, the 'Big Four' venomous snakes (Cobra, Common Krait, Russell's Viper, and Saw-scaled Viper) are responsible for the majority of serious bites and deaths.",
    symptoms: "Symptoms vary based on the type of venom. Neurotoxic venom (e.g., Cobra, Krait) causes progressive paralysis, leading to drooping eyelids (ptosis), difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and ultimately respiratory failure. Hemotoxic venom (e.g., Viper) causes severe local pain and swelling, bleeding from the gums or bite site, blood in the urine, and systemic bleeding due to impaired blood clotting. Fang marks may or may not be visible.",
    prevention: "Prevention involves wearing protective footwear (boots) when walking in tall grass or fields, using a flashlight when walking at night, and avoiding tall grass and piles of debris where snakes may hide. If bitten, the victim should be kept calm and immobilized, and transported immediately to a medical facility for administration of anti-snake venom serum (ASVS). Traditional methods like cutting the wound or applying a tourniquet are strongly discouraged.",
